## What is it?

The Project Diablo 2 Runewizard lets you check easily what runewords you can make in Project Diablo 2, including all updated stats and requirements.

Click on the runes to mark which ones you have found. The available runewords will be highlighted automatically.

The table can be sorted : try clicking on the table headings, you may find it useful!

You can easily search through runeword stats, item types, runes and names of runewords.

## Runes

The runes are listed in order of rarity, from top to bottom, and left to right. The runes upgrade formula in Project Diablo 2 has been changed to the following:

**El - Pul: 3 runes + Key**

**Um - Zod: 2 runes + Key**

## Runewords

**Season 11 New and Updated Runewords** have a small <span class="rw-Table-tdTitlePatch">S11 New/Upd</span> icon next to the name.
